# Python Crash Course 3rd Editiion

A Hands-On, Project-Based  Introduction to Programming.

## Chaper 1 - Getting Started
- Install Python and run first program, hello_world.py.
- Check whether a recent version of Python is installed (python --version).
- Install a text editor.
- Run snippets of Python code in a terminal session.

## Chapter 2 - Variables and Simple Data Types
- Learn about the different kinds of data.
- Use variables.
- Use descriptive variable names and resolve name errors and syntax errors.
- Learn what strings are and how to display them using lowercase, uppercase, and title case.
- Use whitespace to organize output neatly.
- Remove unneeded elements from a string.
- Work with integers, floats, and numerical data.
- Write explanatory comments to make code easier to read.
- The philosophy of keeping code as simple as possible, whenever possible.

## Chapter 3 - Introduction to Lists
- Work with elements in a list.
- Define a list and add/remove elements.
- Sort lists permanently and temporarily for display purposes.
- Find length of a list and how to avoid index errors.

## Chapter 4 - Working With Lists
- Work through list using a for loop.
- Use indentation to structure a program to avoid errors.
- Make simple numerical lists.
- Slice a list to work with a subset of items and copy lists using a slice.
- Use tuples to set values that shouldn't change.
- Style complex code to make it easy to read.

## Chapter 5 - IF Statements
- Write conditional test which always evaluate to True or False.
- Write simple if statements, if-else chains, and if-else-elif chains.
- Use structures to identify particular conditions to test and know when those conditions have been met in a program.
- Handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a for loop.
- Revisit Python's style recommendations to ensure that complex programs are still easy to read and understand.

## Chapter 6 - Dictionaries
- Define a dictionary and how to work with the information stored in a dictionary.
- Access and modify individual elements in a dictionary.
- Loop through all of of the information in a dictionary.
- Loop through a dictionary's key-value pairs, its keys, and its values.
- How to nest multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside a dictionary.

## Chapter 7 - User Input and While Loops
- Use input() to allow users to provide own information in programs.
- Work with both text and numerical input and how to use while loops to make programs run as long as users want them to.
- Ways to control the flow of a while loop by setting an active flag, using the break statement, and uisng the continue statement.
- Use a while loop to move items from one list to another and remove all instances of a value from a list.
- Use while loops with dictionaries.

## Chapter 8 - Functions
- Write functions and pass arguments so that functions have access to the information they need to do their work.
- Use positional and keyword arguments, accept an arbitrary number of arguments.
- Functions that display output and funtions that return values.
- Use functions with lists, dictionaries, if statements, and while loops.
- Store functions in separate files called modules, to make files simpler and easier to understand.
Style funcctionsto ensure programs continue to be well-structured and as easy as possible to read.
