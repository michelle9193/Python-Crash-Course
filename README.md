# Python Crash Course 3rd Editiion

A Hands-On, Project-Based  Introduction to Programming.

## Chaper 1 - Getting Started
- Install Python and run first program, hello_world.py.
- Check whether a recent version of Python is installed (python --version).
- Install a text editor.
- Run snippets of Python code in a terminal session.

## Chapter 2 - Variables and Simple Data Types
- Learn about the different kinds of data.
- Learn how to use variables.
- Learn how to use descriptive variable names and resolve name errors and syntax errors.
- Learn what strings are and how to display them using lowercase, uppercase, and title case.
- Use whitespace to organize output neatly.
- Remove unneeded elements from a string.
- Work with integers, floats, and numerical data.
- Learn how to write explanatory comments to make code easier to read.
- The philosophy of keeping code as simple as possible, whenever possible.

## Chapter 3 - Introduction to Lists
- Work with elements in a list.
- Define a list and add/remove elements.
- Sort lists permanently and temporarily for display purposes.
- Find length of a list and how to avoid index errors.

## Chapter 4 - Working With Lists
- Work through list using a for loop.
- How to use indentation to structure a program to avoid errors.
- Make simple numerical lists.
- Slice a list to work with a subset of items and copy lists using a slice.
- Use tuples to set values that shouldn't change.
- How to style complex code to make it easy to read.

## Chapter 5 - IF Statements
- Write conditional test which always evaluate to True or False.
- Write simple if statements, if-else chains, and if-else-elif chains.
- Use structures to identify particular conditions to test and know when those conditions have been met in a program.
- How to handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a for loop.
- Revisit Python's style recommendations to ensure that complex programs are still easy to read and understand.
